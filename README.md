An application for Windows devices that facilitates the use of the virtual dean's office of the College of Economics and Computer Science in Cracow

## Getting Started

This app was built using WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK.
Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3 is a native user experience (UX) framework for Windows Desktop apps.

You're ready to build, deploy, and launch your app hitting F5. You can find the app entry point in the `App.xaml.cs` file. 
Add a breakpoint in the `OnLaunched` method and debug the code. Step into the `ActivationService` methods to understand the app lifecycle.

Don't forget to review the `developer TODOs` we've added for you. 
You can open the Task List using the menu `Views -> Task List`.
